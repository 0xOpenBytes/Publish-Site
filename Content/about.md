#  About Us

***

<br/>

OpenBytes is a small group of passionate open source developers who come together to collaborate on projects and share their knowledge. Our core members are experienced in mobile development (iOS and Android), web development, and full-stack development and act as mentors for others in the group. They help guide and educate others in the group. Our focus is primarily on mobile development using Kotlin and Swift. In addition to our projects, we also share information and insights on our blog https://openbytes.dev/, where we publish small posts and articles. If you're looking to learn and collaborate with a community of like-minded developers, OpenBytes is the place for you!
